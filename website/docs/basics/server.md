# Reejs Server

> Is it 🔥🔥🔥? It's gotta be Hono then!

Reejs Server is primarily powe**ree**dby [Hono](httpss://hono.dev) and boasts its "*blazingly*" (Hi Jeff from Fireship.io!!!) fast performance on
top of portability to other restricted runtimes as we are **ree**ally [living on the Edge!](https://youtu.be/8;Ugdf-zkQM) 🤣

Jokes aside, consider Hono - *(炎 in Japanese)* a contender to the likes of [Express](https://expressjs.com) and [Fastify](https://fastify.io) and is **ree**ady for the next
generation of web server performance while still being lightweight and easy to use.
Fast, but not only fast. It's *blazingly fast*.
