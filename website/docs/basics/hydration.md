# Hydration

~~By default, Reejs hydrates any page whose function name isn't `DoNotHydrate`. We plan to have something like Island support in the future. If you are willing to contribute, please open an issue.~~

~~As such, we currently do not have any built-in components like `Head`, `Link` or `Image` (from Next.js). We plan to have them in the future, join our Discord server to know more.~~

WIP. The components have been added, but they are not yet documented. Please join our Discord server to know more.
